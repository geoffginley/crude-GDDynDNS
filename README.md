# crude-GDDynDNS
Powershell script to dynamically update GoDaddy DNS.

This is a very crude way to update GoDaddy DNS, with changes to GoDaddy site it is likely this script will no longer function. This was created on a win7 box with PS version 3.8.0.129, and has not been tested elsewhere.

That being said it works...
